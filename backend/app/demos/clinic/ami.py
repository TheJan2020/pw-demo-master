"""
Minimal Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) client.

We don't pull `panoramisk` — AMI is a plain key:value TCP protocol that's
trivial to speak with `asyncio.open_connection`, and avoiding the dep means
no version conflicts on Windows and one less thing to `pip install` per
machine. The client is purpose-built for ONE operation right now: originate
a call from the supervisor's extension and bridge them into a live clinic
call via ChanSpy (barge mode = full 3-way).

A future extension would add `find_channel_for_uuid()` to look up the
AudioSocket channel for a given call_id; for v1 we ring the supervisor's
phone and play the `beep` tone so they know the integration fired — they
can then use FreePBX's *0 (zap-barge) feature code from their phone to
listen in, or we add ChanSpy auto-bridging in v2 once we know the user's
channel-naming convention.
